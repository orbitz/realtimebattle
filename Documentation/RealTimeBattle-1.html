<P>This is the user manual for RealTimeBattle. Here you should find how to run the program,
how the program works, how to create your own robots and how to construct arenas.</P>
<P>RealTimeBattle is a programming game for Unix, in which robots controlled by
programs are fighting each other. The goal is to
destroy the enemies, using the radar to examine the environment and
the cannon to shoot.</P>
<P>Even though the environment the robots are moving in is fairly simple, it is far from easy
to construct an intelligent robot-program. RealTimeBattle is constructed to be easy to
use, flexible and fast. The intention is that the program could be used as a test for
intelligent algorithms, as well as just a game to play and enjoy.</P>
<P>Features include:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Game progresses in real time, with the robot programs running
as child processes to RealTimeBattle.
</LI>
<LI>  The robots communicate with the main program using the standard
input and output.
</LI>
<LI> Robots can be constructed in almost any programming language.
</LI>
<LI> Up to 120 robots can compete simultaneously.
</LI>
<LI> A simple messaging language is used for communication, which
makes easy to start constructing robots.
</LI>
<LI> Robots behave like real physical object.
</LI>
<LI> You can create your own arenas.
</LI>
<LI> Highly configurable.
</LI>
<LI> Possibility to plug in external clients.
</LI>
<LI> Basic team support directly integrated in the game, sophisticated team play available due to team frameworks.

<P>More information can be found in the <CODE>INSTALL</CODE>, <CODE>AUTHORS</CODE>, <CODE>BUGS</CODE>, <CODE>TODO</CODE>,
<CODE>README</CODE>, <CODE>FAQ</CODE> and <CODE>ChangeLog</CODE> files in the 
distribution. More updated information is available on the 
<A HREF="http://realtimebattle.sf.net">RealTimeBattle homepage</A>, where 
you can also find robots, news on tournaments as well as this manual in different formats.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Requirements"></A> <A NAME="ss1.2">1.2</A> <A HREF="RealTimeBattle.html#toc1.2">Requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>The hardware requirements are very much dependent on what you do.  Running a few robots
should be possible to do on any computer on which GNU/Linux or any other Unixes can be
run. The demand on hardware will, however, grow with the number of robots you want on the
battlefield simultaneously; running 120 advanced robots is certainly demanding for any
personal computer.</P>
<P>RealTimeBattle is only available on Unix.  It is developed on a Linux-machine, but it
should compile on other Unix dialects too. Running in 
<A HREF="RealTimeBattle-2.html#Command line options">competition-mode</A> is currently only possible on Linux with the '/proc'-directory
enabled, because of the need to get the cpu usage of child processes.</P>
<P>The only software requirement is 
<A HREF="http://www.gtk.org">gtk+</A>, which is used for
the graphical user interface.</P>


<H2><A NAME="Background"></A> <A NAME="ss1.3">1.3</A> <A HREF="RealTimeBattle.html#toc1.3">Background</A>
</H2>

<P>The project started in August 1998. Inspiration came from 
<A HREF="http://www.robotbattle.com/">RobotBattle</A>, a very
interesting game we used to enjoy some years earlier. That version of
RobotBattle, however, had some drawbacks: It was only available on
Windows and the robots were written in an own language, which restricts the
possibilities to write intelligent robots. RobotBattle has since then been
under development, but it still lack support for other
operative systems.</P>
<P>We therefore decided to construct a Unix robot programming game, which
makes use of features of a modern OS.</P>
